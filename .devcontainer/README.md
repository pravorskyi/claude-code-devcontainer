# Not what you're looking for

This `.devcontainer` is used for developing this project itself. The published images are **not** built from here — they are built from the upstream [Anthropic `.devcontainer`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) via the submodule.

See the [main README](../README.md) for usage instructions.
